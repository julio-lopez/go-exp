# Go Experiments and Examples

Collection of assorted experiments and _starting points_ for Go.

In general, each directory has a self-contained experimental or starting point for a project.

A _starting point_ project is the minimum set of source and configuration files for a project using some service, framework or library. Think of these as a combination of _"hello world"_ examples and templates. For example, suppose you want to build a (single) micro-service using gRPC. Then the starting project for this purpose contains the simplest definition and implementation of such service, something like the "echo service". It includes the corresponding gRPC/Probotobuf definitions,  client and server implementations, along with simple unit tests.
